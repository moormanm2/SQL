This project utilized data from the Netflix database stored at http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/7dae0/5341

1. This query counts how many files I have in my table "netflix_people".
SELECT count(*) FROM "netflix_people"

2. This query shows me 5 of the files from the table "netflix_people".
SELECT * FROM "netflix_people" LIMIT 5

3. This query shows me 5 of the files from the table "netflix_titles_info".
SELECT * FROM "netflix_titles_info" LIMIT 5

4. This query joins information from both tables to show me 5 titles and their director.
SELECT "netflix_titles_info".title, "netflix_people".director FROM "netflix_people"
JOIN "netflix_titles_info" 
ON "netflix_people".show_id = "netflix_titles_info".show_id LIMIT 5

5. This query shows how many movie titles are there in the database. (movies only, not tv shows) 
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'

6. Both of these quieries show when the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies was added to the database.
SELECT title, date_added 
From "netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY date_added DESC LIMIT 1

SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "netflix_titles_info"

7. This lists all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
SELECT title 
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY "netflix_titles_info".title

8. In this query it shows who was the Director for the movie The Starling.
SELECT titles.title, people.director
FROM "netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN "netflix_people" people
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'The Starling'

9. This query finds what movie is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made.
