1. (Self-join) Here I created a table to see what each movie stars main role is in movies.
SELECT movie_stars.name, career_details.role     FROM movie_stars
    JOIN career_details
    ON movie_stars.id = career_details.person_id;

2. (Combinging JOINs) This created a table that showed me the movie stars that collaborate best with the other movie stars in my "movie_stars" table.
SELECT a.name, b.name FROM best_collaborator
    JOIN movie_stars a
    ON best_collaborator.person1_id = a.id
    JOIN movie_stars b
    ON best_collaborator.person2_id = b.id;

3. (self-join) This code created a table showing each movies star in my "movie_stars" table and how many films they were in as their main role.    
SELECT movie_stars.name, career_details.number_of_film     FROM movie_stars
    JOIN career_details
    ON movie_stars.id = career_details.person_id;

4. Here I put the movie stars in descending order by their age.
SELECT name, age FROM movie_stars
    ORDER BY age DESC
