**DATA ANALYSIS**

-- Determine whether paid apps have higher rating than free apps

/* Stakeholders can analyze the relationship between app pricing and ratings. 
If paid apps consistently have higher ratings, developers might consider 
charging a fee for their apps to convey higher quality and attract more positive 
reviews.
*/

-- Check if apps with more supported langueges have higher ratings 

/* This tells stakeholders if it is important to include more language 
supports for better ratings.
*/

         END AS language_bucket,

ORDER BY Avg_Rating DESC;

-- Check genres with low ratings 

/* This will show our stakeholder that apps in these genres are getting 
low ratings. This can be used to know what genres would be good to 
build an app for because the others are lacking.
*/

SELECT prime_genre,
		avg(user_rating) AS Avg_Rating

ORDER BY Avg_Rating ASC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check if there is correlation betwwen the length of the app description and the user rating

length they should be sure to include in their app to help with their rating.
*/

-- Check the top-rated apps for each genre 

/* This could be a good insight for our stakeholder to check these apps 
as the top performing ones. So, ideally these are the ones this person
should try to emulate.
*/

 /* Final Reccomandations
 1. Paid apps have better ratings.
	- If they percieve the quality of their apps to be good then they should consider 
    charging a certain amount for the app. 
 2. Apps supporting between 10 and 30 language have better ratings. 
 	- So, it is not really about the quantity of the languages that your app
    supports, it is more about focusing on the right languages. 
 3. Finance and Book apps have low ratings. 
 	- This suggest that user needs are not being fully met and this can represent a 
    market of opportunity. If you can create a quality app in these categories that
    addresses user needs better than the current offering there is potential for high 
    user ratings and market penetration.
 4. Apps with a longer description have better ratings. 
 	- Users likely appreciate having a clear understanding of the app's features and 
    capabilities before the download. So, a detailed well crafted app description can 
    set clear expectation and eventually increase the satisfaction of users. 
 5. A new app should aim for an average rating above 3.5. 
 	- On average all the apps have a rating of 3.5, so in order to stand out for the 
    crowd their rating needs to be above that.
 6. Games and Entertainment categories have high competition. 
 	- These categories have high volume of apps suggesting the market may be saturated. 
    However it also suggests a high user demand in these sectors.
